# Data-Extraction-from-txt
Extract the data from a text file containing information regarding the conversations between an expert and user

The text file contains the numerous conversations that are seperated by '***...'. 

My task here is to extract the following information from the file:
1. collection_number
2. conversation_number 
3. start_time 
4. started_by 
5. end_time
6. ended_by

I use python and pandas for this text extraction and stored them into the data frame.
